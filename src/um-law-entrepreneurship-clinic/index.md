## student attorney at um law school entrepreneurship clinic

For one academic year I represented and advised startup ventures on a variety of matters, including entity formation, entity conversion, equity compensation, fundraising and securities regulation, intellectual property (copyright and trademark), terms of use and privacy policy, employee and independent contractor agreements, and tax law. I also conducted client-specific research, reviewed and drafted documents, and supported the University’s entrepreneurship community by holding office hours and delivering crash-course seminars on startup law. I also authored blog posts on timely startup legal issues arising out of our practice.
