## Revenue.io

Revenue.io is a B2B SaaS platform that leverages generative AI-and real-time guidance to supercharge the performance of sales and customer success teams. As Principal PM, I:

- Shipped 0→1 portfolio of 6+ LLM-powered sales-enablement and CS-enablement features _(‘Ask Revenue’ Chatbot, Conversation Highlights, Generative AI Scorecards, User Profiles, Recipes,_ and _Moments™ Dashboard_) that delivered immediate in-product lift (5x engagement at launch) and set stage for AI Agents (such as AI Call/Deal Scorers, Summarizers, & Ask-Anything assistants)
    
- Led company-wide velocity program to push all features through internal beta in <2 weeks, cut feature flags by 50% and 2x insight capture, accelerating time-to-ship release tempo and learning cadence
