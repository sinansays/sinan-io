## University of Michigan ARC-TS Flux High Performance Computing Cluster Project

Advanced Research Computing – Technology Services ([ARC-TS](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/)) provides the [Flux HPC cluster](http://arc-ts.umich.edu/systems-and-services/flux/), which researchers can use for compute- or data-intensive investigations. Our team was brought in to improve support and documentation efficacy, with the goal of addressing user on-boarding and ongoing support needs, as well as reducing unnecessary user interaction with support staff. We employed contextual inquiry and human-centered design methodologies to collect, represent, and analyze data about ARC-TS processes, workflows, and services. **_Project deliverables are available upon request._**
